# E-Commerce Inventory Management Using AI  

## Overview  
This project implements **E-Commerce Inventory Management** using **Hill Climbing Algorithm** and **Best-First Search Algorithm** to optimize stock levels, reduce costs, and enhance efficiency. AI-driven decision-making helps in demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and warehouse management.  

## Features  
- 🔄 **AI-powered stock optimization**  
- 📊 **Demand prediction & inventory control**  
- 🚀 **Efficient search algorithms for decision-making**  
- 🏬 **Warehouse and supply chain management**  
- 💡 **Minimizes overstocking & understocking risks**  

## Algorithms Used  

### **1. Hill Climbing Algorithm**  
A heuristic search algorithm that iteratively improves inventory decisions by making local changes and moving towards an optimal stock level.  

- Evaluates stock levels based on demand, storage costs, and supply chain constraints.  
- Iteratively adjusts stock quantities to minimize holding costs and prevent shortages.  
- Stops when no further improvements can be made.  

### **2. Best-First Search Algorithm**  
A pathfinding algorithm that selects the most promising inventory decision at each step based on an evaluation function.  

- Prioritizes restocking decisions with the highest impact on reducing stockouts.  
- Dynamically adjusts inventory based on demand predictions.  
- Helps in selecting optimal suppliers and warehouse distribution strategies.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **AI & ML:** Machine Learning for demand forecasting
